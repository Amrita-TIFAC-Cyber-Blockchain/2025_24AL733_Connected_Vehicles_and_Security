### Problem Statement
<div align="justify">
5G networks rely on small cells with limited coverage range, typically a few hundred meters. To maintain seamless connectivity, a moving device must perform handovers—switching its connection from one small cell to the next—in mere milliseconds.
Consider a vehicle traveling at 120 km/h (approximately 33 m/s). At this speed, it covers the diameter of a typical small cell in just seconds. If the vehicle enters a coverage gap, known as a "dead zone," or encounters a delayed handover due to network congestion, overloaded signaling, or interference, the connection may drop abruptly. This can interrupt data-intensive applications like streaming, navigation, or emerging autonomous driving features, highlighting the challenges of providing reliable high-speed mobile coverage in dense 5G deployments.

### Used Case 
<div align="justify">
If the vehicle is relying on Remote Driving (Tele-operation) or cloud-based AI for navigation, the connection drops. The vehicle essentially "goes blind" for 1–2 seconds. In a high-speed curve or intersection, this brief loss of control results in a departure from the lane or a collision with infrastructure. 
The Critical Outcome: If the vehicle is relying on Remote Driving (Tele-operation) or cloud-based AI for navigation, the connection drops. The vehicle essentially "goes blind" for 1–2 seconds. In a high-speed curve or intersection, this brief loss of control results in a departure from the lane or a collision with infrastructure.
