### Problem Statement
Modern vehicles rely on in-vehicle communication networks to enable real-time data exchange between multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol has been widely adopted due to its reliability and deterministic timing. However, the increasing number of ECUs and data-intensive vehicle functions have exposed bandwidth and latency limitations in traditional CAN-based networks.

To address these limitations, CAN with Flexible Data Rate (CAN FD) was introduced, offering higher payload capacity and improved communication performance. While existing studies demonstrate significant performance improvements with CAN FD, both CAN and CAN FD lack native security mechanisms such as authentication, encryption, and access control.

As a result, in-vehicle networks remain vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as message spoofing, replay attacks, and denial-of-service, even in CAN FD-based architectures. Most existing solutions address security using external mechanisms like intrusion detection systems or secure gateways, rather than inherent protocol-level protections.

The core problem addressed in this project is to analyze and compare the security vulnerabilities of traditional CAN and CAN FD, and to determine whether CAN FD provides any inherent security improvement or simply enhances communication performance while inheriting the same vulnerabilities.
